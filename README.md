# JavaScript Basics Workshop

A short lecture on some JavaScript basics should take place before working on the solutions to these bugs.

## Fixing the bugs

Run `npm test` and notice all the test failures. Start at `bug-1` and fix the failure so the test passes. Use the JS knowledge you've gained through the lecture (or from prior knowledge) to solve the problems. Rerun `npm test` to see the passes increase and failures decrease.

If you are having issues, you can run the `*.fix.js` file as a regular Node app, which means you can also run it in debug more, or put some `console.log` statements in there ... just write `node <filename>` to run it as a Node app or use your IDE's debug server to run it and use breakpoints.

## The solutions

There are the final solutions in the solutions branch, so `git checkout solutions` to find how they can be solved. Remember that these are contrived examples that could possibly have dozens of solutions. The ones you see here are just mine :)

Once you have all green in your tests, try to optimize the code to make it better.
